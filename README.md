# Telecommunication Network - CCN Project

# 📌 Project Overview

The Telecommunication Network project is designed to build a high-performance Ethernet-based infrastructure for seamless communication between an office block and a warehouse. This network integrates subnetting, dynamic routing (RIP), VLANs, NAT, and ACLs to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability. Implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, this project ensures smooth data exchange between departments while optimizing resource utilization.

# 🚀 Features

# 🔹 Network Infrastructure

✔ Ethernet-based network with structured cabling (Cat 6 or Cat 7 with signal boosters for long-distance connectivity).✔ Subnetting & IP Allocation for different departments (Sales, Marketing, Equipment, and Services).✔ Dynamic Routing (RIP) for efficient inter-department communication.✔ Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce security policies.✔ Network Address Translation (NAT) for secure external communication.✔ VLAN Assignments for logical traffic segregation.

# 🔹 Security & Optimization

✔ Subnet-based IP allocation to prevent conflicts.✔ Optimized routing for low-latency communication.✔ Bandwidth Estimation to ensure smooth operations.

# ⚙ Tech Stack & Networking Concepts

# 🔹 Networking Concepts Implemented

✅ Subnetting & IP Addressing for optimized device management.
✅ Routing Protocols (RIP v2) for efficient data transfer.
✅ VLAN Segmentation to manage network traffic efficiently.
✅ Access Control Lists (ACLs) for security enforcement.
✅ NAT Configuration to enable secure external communication.

# 🛠 Development Tools
